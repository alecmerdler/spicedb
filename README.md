SpiceDB is a [Zanzibar]-inspired database that stores, computes, and validates application permissions.

Developers create a schema that models their permissions requirements and use a [client library] to apply the schema to the database, insert data into the database, and query the data to efficiently check permissions in their applications.

Features that distinguish SpiceDB from other systems include:
- [Dedicated APIs] for checking individual permissions, listing all access, and [ACL filtering]
- An architecture faithful to the [Google Zanzibar] paper, including resistance to the [New Enemy Problem]
- An intuitive and expressive [schema language] complete with a [playground] dev environment
- A powerful graph engine that supports distributed, parallel evaluation
- Pluggable storage that supports [in-memory], [PostgreSQL], and [CockroachDB]
- Deep observability with [Prometheus metrics], structured logging, and [distributed tracing]

See [CONTRIBUTING.md] for instructions on how to contribute and perform common tasks like building the project and running tests.

## Why SpiceDB?

### Verifiably Correct

The data used to calculate permissions have the most critical correctness requirements in the entirety a software system.
Despite that, developers continue to build their own ad-hoc solutions coupled to the internal code of each new project.
By developing a SpiceDB schema, you can iterate far more quickly and exhaustively test designs before altering any application code.
This becomes especially important as you introduce backwards-compatible changes to the schema and want to ensure that the system remains secure.

### Fast

SpiceDB is designed for high-throughput and low-latency. 
It will never be the weak link in your infrastructure.

### Flexible

The SpiceDB schema langauge declares a graph of relationships between objects.
This ReBAC design is capable of efficiently supporting all popular access control models (such as [RBAC] and [ABAC]) and custom models that contain hybrid behavior.

### Decoupled From Application _and_ Data

Modern solutions to developing permission systems all have a similar goal: to decouple _policy_ from the application.
Using a dedicated database like SpiceDB not only accomplishes this, but takes this idea a step further by also decoupling the data that policies operate on.
SpiceDB is designed to share a single unified view of permissions across as many applications as your organization has.
This has strategy has become an industry best-practice and is being used to great success at companies large ([Google], GitHub, [Airbnb]) and small ([Carta], [Authzed]).

## Installation

### Pulling down a container image

The latest stable release can be obtained by running the following command:

```sh
docker pull quay.io/authzed/spicedb:latest
```

For production usage, we **highly** recommend using a tag that corresponds to the [latest release], rather than `latest`.

[latest release]: https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/releases

### Building and installing a binary

In order to build and install SpiceDB, the [latest stable version of Go] must be installed.

Running the following command will install the latest stable release: 

```sh
go install github.com/authzed/spicedb/cmd/spicedb@latest
```

[latest stable version of Go]: https://golang.org/dl
[working Go environment]: https://golang.org/doc/code.html
